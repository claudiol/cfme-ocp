# CloudForms and OpenShift Container Platform Integration
As of CloudForms 4.0, not only can one monitor and manage cloud workloads, but container workloads as well.  CloudForms provides a single pane of glass view into a hybrid cloud infrastructure.  From one interface a user can interact with both their IaaS and their PaaS.

CloudForms 4.1 brought many improvements for both IaaS and PaaS.  This automate model allows a user to provision an OCP project via a CloudForms Service Catalog Item (more features to come).  This is useful if the OCP administrators wish to disable the self-service provisioner capability in OCP, and add an approval workflow to provisioning a project

This relies on the [Kubeclient Ruby Gem](https://github.com/abonas/kubeclient).

If you wish to checkout the upstream project for CloudForms, take a look at [ManageIQ](http://manageiq.org/).
